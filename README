Runs on Python

Required Packages:
numpy, matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, igraph, sklearn


To test the code:

Use run.py. To run mds, neuc-mds, and neuc-mds+ on some given distance matrix, do the following:

standard_one_run(distance_matrix, target_dimension)

There is an example at the bottom of the file. If you want to test landmark_mds run the following:

landmark_mds(distance_matrix, num_landmarks, target_dimension)

To look at eigenvalues of a distance matrix, you can use the .graph_eigenvalues() function
